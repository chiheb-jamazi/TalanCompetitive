They a progressive company that sets strong I&D goals and strives to create a great place to work. Part of consulting is constantly learning, developing new skills and getting new experiences. Work life balance is somewhat prioritized. I never work on vacations, but there are definitely grinding weeks. I think Accenture is always striving to be the best that they can be, even if they don't always get it right.","It's a huge company and sometimes it's easy to feel a little lost, especially when your network leaves to go elsewhere. There are times when it gets exhausting to be constantly needing to become an expert in a new thing, whether you have any interest in it or not. There are always difficult clients and while leadership will mostly have your back when working with a difficult or unreasonable client, they will often side with the client to maintain good relationships."

If you get tapped internally you can spend time on cool projects and learn a lot.

There are very cool sides of Accenture that are worth joining -- Accenture Digital, Fjord, Accenture Interactive.","Long time's spent on the ""bench"", waiting to get called on projects. You would wait 3/4 months waiting for a project, but interviewing for new projects. Management gives no clear guidelines for skills you should be picking up to make it easier to get slotted for projects. In my starting vlass, most analysts were given projects where they mostly sat all day and did nothing.

Projects and Roles are found via interview process. You need to interview internally at shipper for roles, creating a lord of the flies type situation. Where everyone is competing, and networking all the time to get the best roles. But when you find a good role and are accepted for the role, you would often times be pulled from the project last minute because an MD had a 'pet-analyst' they were looking out for and would staff them instead.

The guidance was very unclear and unstructured. Projects are sold to internal employees as HL strategy projects, but are mostly copy-paste implementation solutions for SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, etc. Moreover, it's downright impossible to get off of projects, you could be stuck for 6-12 months in a clerical role.

If you're looking to build skills in consulting, it's only ""good"" by name itself, but overall think I would have preferred to go to a startup, or different firm."

- Management Consulting of Accenture is great. I've heard good stories about that vertical. Technical Consulting is usual service organization type.
- Project can be good, bad or extremely bad, depending on the vertical you are getting into. For instance, if it is Telecommunications, then expect rude bosses, low bonuses and crappy work; Banking is good, but comes with short shelf life; Healthcare & Insurance are going to be bureaucratic but with OK work. 
- Good company to travel abroad and around
- Salaries have become competitive lately due to high attrition","- Very watered down technical environment. Leadership and upper management are mostly non-techies so learn to explain your technical problems like you are explaining a 10 years old
- Kiss up and kick down culture, especially in lower ranks (below Senior Manager levels)
- As you climb up the corporate ladder, you'd be expected to work less technically, and more on sales and RFP (proposal) work
- Against all odds, if you stay techie and do less RFP work, promotions will be few and far between
- Manager/boss is everything in Accenture. Keep him impressed.
- Accenture HRs are all powerful entities. Never. Ever. confront an HR.
- Appraisals, promotions and moderations are all fixed. Managers target who is going to be promoted and who is not, regardless of your good work. Bonuses, however, depends on your work, but in big accounts they'll be rationed.
- Middle management in tech, especially in countries like USA and UK, are mostly south asians. They have their own code of life and work. Familiarize yourself with those if you need to rise."

- Some extremely caring and extremely intelligent leaders who have made peace with how to be successful despite the many obstacles and ongoing bureaucracy of org size 
- The new Droga-led direction of Interactive is encouraging but too early to gauge","- Darwinian experiment-like survival is an accepted part of company; this aspect is placed above and trumps any efforts at achieving a coherent company culture; this persisting ready/fire/aim, and ""acquire now/integrate never"" dynamic places the bulk of the pressure on managers and senior managers still aspiring to achieve the coveted Managing Director promotion; and once achieved, most discover the organizational goal posts have simply moved towards that of Senior MD; the money is ""just enough"" to stay for roughly half
- By any reasonable measure, and regardless of political leanings, new CEO and leadership has bizarrely over-indexed on woke stances and policy implementations to the detriment of client value, market impact, and shareholder value
- Significant % of senior-level leadership actively avoids doing work, instead favoring internal political gameplay (look busy, be unreachable, attach yourself to successful teams) instead of contributing tangible productive impact and influence over those efforts"

If you are in a practice that has too many people and not enough work, some people will be laid off.  Let's suppose that you've created an opportunity with a new client.  A managing director that needs an engagement to keep occupied will take over the client and purposely abuse you so that you'll quit.  This clears the way for the managing director to replace you with a friend.  This is so common that I witnessed a managing director joke about how another managing director was ""very good"" at ""stealing credit"" for other people's work at a business dinner."

Accenture will be a paradise for you. Stay here and retire with lots of benefits like discounted company shares, 401K etc. etc. 

* If you know how to work 'smart'. Be in the right place at the right time in front of right people and take the credits, you will go to senior management and leadership. Once you become Sr. Manager, your life is set. You have no targets, no obligations to fulfill. You can literally spend you days at the beach for next 10 years and retire with fantastic savings and benefits by the end of your career. But to get there, you have to do a lot of course!","I am obviously sharing my personal view and my perspective after working for 7 years here. I am writing things being unbiased and true to my heart: 

* In it's core, Accenture is a service-based, head-count based, body-shopping company with posh appearances and luxury talks about technology, data analytics, machine learning, automation and AI.

* At high level, Accenture is a company led by a CEO who clearly is a misandrist or more accurately, a female chauvinist. I'm all for gender equality. However, you can't penalize hard-working, talented, motivated men in the name of women empowerment. She did that and it simply created a toxic environment. Her new policies have caused a lot of friction and insubordination in every team across the org. Her impulsive and pre-matured decisions while making new policies clearly lacking proper strategy will cost everyone sailing in this gigantic, over-crowded ship. Not only employees but also their families suffer due to her recent changes.

* For talented, growth oriented, career focused people, know that Accenture is filled with old, tired, lethargic, non-upgraded leaders who are full of politics and ride their high horses. They are neither result-oriented nor growth oriented. They get their fat bonus and company shares and are happy playing golf on weekends.

* It's an over-crowded chaos. (700K+ employees worldwide). You being the primary controller of your destiny is a far fetched idea. 

* 5% of people are those who actually work and earn the bread for the company and 80% are unproductive leads, Managers, Sr. Managers, leaderships, HR overheads, process facilitators, talent specialists, travel agents etc.. who do less than a post-man and just send e-mails from end point to other. Yes. They'll take credit for sure. Rest 15% are floating pool who keep getting hired (with anticipation of new projects) and fired (when the new projects aren't signed)

* Heavily hit by recent attrition trend. I'm not kidding but literally there are more managers than workers. Work of 1 person is showcased by 10 people as 'their' work in 10 different places. 1 person had one career-counsellor manager, one project manager, HR manager and one people manager and sometimes an onshore and offshore manager! So totally 4 to 5 managers for 1 worker! This is REALITY. I am not joking. You are better off free-lancing than being here. At least there, you will be in control of your actions and consequences. 

* Company talks about 'equality' but higher positions get business class treatment and lower position gets economy class treatment. Lower positions are shown their place even for basic social necessities like health insurance. A senior official who can afford more gets higher coverage for less cost but a fresher gets less coverage for high premium! So much for equality! 

* All in all, it's a good pit-stop destination if you're a fresher. If you are serious about learning and growing, stay away. It's a TRAP. Once you spend more than 3 years here, you are stuck for lifetime! You won't be up-to market standards and won't have latest skills and hence can't jump this toxic org. 
 
* Special mention to senior managers from 'Indian-origin' and their hierarchical, age-old mindset of boot polishing!. I would stay as far away as possible. They bring poor people from third world countries to the US with high aspirations and promises, suck the life out of them and use them until they can take the 'credits' but also expect them to be 'grateful'. They are thrown away if they ever ask for good bonus, fair rewards or recognition. (of course like any other IT company). So, most of the people you would interact on a daily basis are passive aggressive, stressed, poor, low-self-esteem people who are probably struggling with a side hustle along with their full-time job. You would initially get a over-humble response but later regret being in this org. (happens all the time in every project) 

* Basically, everyone I've met here is unhappy. But they put up a big smile cuz they have to!. They have given a part of their life for accenture and now they want to sit back, relax, attend meetings, talk about their cute dogs and exotic cuisine and have their pay-checks coming. So, imagine your fate if you actually want to learn and grow! 

* Diversity is highly advertised but followed only on postures and bill boards. Institutional racism is clearly visible and felt but of-course as it happens to only non-privileged people, everyone would say it's not real and just a mind-set.

* If you are in the US, if you're an out-sider, you get condescended by the locals. If you're a local, you get to work with people who know nothing about US life or work culture. It's a thorn with pointy end on both sides! 

* The list goes on if I have to rant and nit pick; bottom line is. In every service-based org, your experience and luck depends on what kind of project and which team you'll end up after a year or 2. 
Sometimes it can be good but most of the time, with a mammoth sized org which keeps acquiring new orgs and builds toxic work culture, it's not good for talented people. 
Use the points above and choose wisely!"

Accenture's prices are HIGH compared to other consulting firms, so senior management often sells very intense scopes of work on very short timelines and with understaffed teams to be competitive with other options and sell their work. You get stuck on an over-worked team. They also use you for your low rate if you show you can perform at a higher level - AKA if you're a consultant that can manage project delivery, they'll use you to do it - but you won't get paid for it or won't get promoted. Or even worse and in my case, you sell work, and you don't get the commission - the leaders who did nothing get the commission. The promotion process is also very intense and you have to do a lot to stand out to leadership at such a big, fragmented company. You also get very minimal PTO and holidays and have to use your PTO when you're sick - no sick days. The main skills you learn are how to deal with ambiguity, how to communicate, how to build great power points, and how to use critical thinking skills. You rarely get depth of knowledge in a field, making it difficult to exit. Accenture is a big ""talk the talk but doesn't walk the walk"" company when it comes to its values. It's great in theory but everything depends on upper leadership - and upper leadership cannot receive upward feedback that feeds into their evaluations."

As a global company, there is always something new. Your project can change much more often than other companies, and that keeps me challenged & continuously learning. I have been able to accumulate tons of experience, all with the same company. They look for similar skills that can be applied in different areas, which allows for that growth. Most companies will not do that, and expect you to have exact experience to try new roles/areas. But with that old school methodology, you'd essentially have to start at the bottom with any change of industry. At Accenture they look for the likenesses they can apply for you to be successful in the new role, which is quite different. I also love their initiatives and engagement events aimed towards Inclusiveness & Diversity. It's a real thing at our company, and I see the programs and the initiatives to push for equal opportunity.","The con's that people may see with our company are the immense amount of learnings required. Accenture is very big on continuous learning and ensuring their employees are up to date on Technology and the 'next big thing', like AI and Block Chain. That may not be a priority for everyone in the world and that may not fit well with a person's mind set when looking for a job. But it's important for all of us to stay relevant in our industry and we know we have to continuously grow with our skills and ideas. It is something I explain to anyone I interview externally."

If you get tapped internally you can spend time on cool projects and learn a lot.

There are very cool sides of Accenture that are worth joining -- Accenture Digital, Fjord, Accenture Interactive.","Long time's spent on the ""bench"", waiting to get called on projects. You would wait 3/4 months waiting for a project, but interviewing for new projects. Management gives no clear guidelines for skills you should be picking up to make it easier to get slotted for projects. In my starting vlass, most analysts were given projects where they mostly sat all day and did nothing.

Projects and Roles are found via interview process. You need to interview internally at shipper for roles, creating a lord of the flies type situation. Where everyone is competing, and networking all the time to get the best roles. But when you find a good role and are accepted for the role, you would often times be pulled from the project last minute because an MD had a 'pet-analyst' they were looking out for and would staff them instead.

The guidance was very unclear and unstructured. Projects are sold to internal employees as HL strategy projects, but are mostly copy-paste implementation solutions for SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, etc. Moreover, it's downright impossible to get off of projects, you could be stuck for 6-12 months in a clerical role.

Decent work/life balance if you set your own personal boundaries (also depends on your manager)","Senior leadership is incentivized by the amount of sales they make. Accenture's prices are HIGH compared to other consulting firms, so senior management often sells very intense scopes of work on very short timelines and with understaffed teams to be competitive with other options and sell their work. You get stuck on an over-worked team. They also use you for your low rate if you show you can perform at a higher level - AKA if you're a consultant that can manage project delivery, they'll use you to do it - but you won't get paid for it or won't get promoted. Or even worse and in my case, you sell work, and you don't get the commission - the leaders who did nothing get the commission. The promotion process is also very intense and you have to do a lot to stand out to leadership at such a big, fragmented company. You also get very minimal PTO and holidays and have to use your PTO when you're sick - no sick days. The main skills you learn are how to deal with ambiguity, how to communicate, how to build great power points, and how to use critical thinking skills. You rarely get depth of knowledge in a field, making it difficult to exit. Accenture is a big ""talk the talk but doesn't walk the walk"" company when it comes to its values. It's great in theory but everything depends on upper leadership - and upper leadership cannot receive upward feedback that feeds into their evaluations."

If you are in a practice that has too many people and not enough work, some people will be laid off.  Let's suppose that you've created an opportunity with a new client.  A managing director that needs an engagement to keep occupied will take over the client and purposely abuse you so that you'll quit.  This clears the way for the managing director to replace you with a friend.  This is so common that I witnessed a managing director joke about how another managing director was ""very good"" at ""stealing credit"" for other people's work at a business dinner."
5.0,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",Awesome company to work for,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Accenture-RVW61346241.htm,"Mar 17, 2022 - Senior Manager","What has kept me at Accenture 10+ years is the Opportunities they offer. As a global company, there is always something new. Your project can change much more often than other companies, and that keeps me challenged & continuously learning. I have been able to accumulate tons of experience, all with the same company. They look for similar skills that can be applied in different areas, which allows for that growth. Most companies will not do that, and expect you to have exact experience to try new roles/areas. But with that old school methodology, you'd essentially have to start at the bottom with any change of industry. At Accenture they look for the likenesses they can apply for you to be successful in the new role, which is quite different. I also love their initiatives and engagement events aimed towards Inclusiveness & Diversity. It's a real thing at our company, and I see the programs and the initiatives to push for equal opportunity.","The con's that people may see with our company are the immense amount of learnings required. Accenture is very big on continuous learning and ensuring their employees are up to date on Technology and the 'next big thing', like AI and Block Chain. That may not be a priority for everyone in the world and that may not fit well with a person's mind set when looking for a job. But it's important for all of us to stay relevant in our industry and we know we have to continuously grow with our skills and ideas. It is something I explain to anyone I interview externally."

Accenture will be a paradise for you. Stay here and retire with lots of benefits like discounted company shares, 401K etc. etc. 

* If you know how to work 'smart'. Be in the right place at the right time in front of right people and take the credits, you will go to senior management and leadership. Once you become Sr. Manager, your life is set. You have no targets, no obligations to fulfill. You can literally spend you days at the beach for next 10 years and retire with fantastic savings and benefits by the end of your career. But to get there, you have to do a lot of course!","I am obviously sharing my personal view and my perspective after working for 7 years here. I am writing things being unbiased and true to my heart: 

* In it's core, Accenture is a service-based, head-count based, body-shopping company with posh appearances and luxury talks about technology, data analytics, machine learning, automation and AI.

* At high level, Accenture is a company led by a CEO who clearly is a misandrist or more accurately, a female chauvinist. I'm all for gender equality. However, you can't penalize hard-working, talented, motivated men in the name of women empowerment. She did that and it simply created a toxic environment. Her new policies have caused a lot of friction and insubordination in every team across the org. Her impulsive and pre-matured decisions while making new policies clearly lacking proper strategy will cost everyone sailing in this gigantic, over-crowded ship. Not only employees but also their families suffer due to her recent changes.

* For talented, growth oriented, career focused people, know that Accenture is filled with old, tired, lethargic, non-upgraded leaders who are full of politics and ride their high horses. They are neither result-oriented nor growth oriented. They get their fat bonus and company shares and are happy playing golf on weekends.

* It's an over-crowded chaos. (700K+ employees worldwide). You being the primary controller of your destiny is a far fetched idea. 

* 5% of people are those who actually work and earn the bread for the company and 80% are unproductive leads, Managers, Sr. Managers, leaderships, HR overheads, process facilitators, talent specialists, travel agents etc.. who do less than a post-man and just send e-mails from end point to other. Yes. They'll take credit for sure. Rest 15% are floating pool who keep getting hired (with anticipation of new projects) and fired (when the new projects aren't signed)

* Heavily hit by recent attrition trend. I'm not kidding but literally there are more managers than workers. Work of 1 person is showcased by 10 people as 'their' work in 10 different places. 1 person had one career-counsellor manager, one project manager, HR manager and one people manager and sometimes an onshore and offshore manager! So totally 4 to 5 managers for 1 worker! This is REALITY. I am not joking. You are better off free-lancing than being here. At least there, you will be in control of your actions and consequences. 

* Company talks about 'equality' but higher positions get business class treatment and lower position gets economy class treatment. Lower positions are shown their place even for basic social necessities like health insurance. A senior official who can afford more gets higher coverage for less cost but a fresher gets less coverage for high premium! So much for equality! 

* All in all, it's a good pit-stop destination if you're a fresher. If you are serious about learning and growing, stay away. It's a TRAP. Once you spend more than 3 years here, you are stuck for lifetime! You won't be up-to market standards and won't have latest skills and hence can't jump this toxic org. 
 
* Special mention to senior managers from 'Indian-origin' and their hierarchical, age-old mindset of boot polishing!. I would stay as far away as possible. They bring poor people from third world countries to the US with high aspirations and promises, suck the life out of them and use them until they can take the 'credits' but also expect them to be 'grateful'. They are thrown away if they ever ask for good bonus, fair rewards or recognition. (of course like any other IT company). So, most of the people you would interact on a daily basis are passive aggressive, stressed, poor, low-self-esteem people who are probably struggling with a side hustle along with their full-time job. You would initially get a over-humble response but later regret being in this org. (happens all the time in every project) 

* Basically, everyone I've met here is unhappy. But they put up a big smile cuz they have to!. They have given a part of their life for accenture and now they want to sit back, relax, attend meetings, talk about their cute dogs and exotic cuisine and have their pay-checks coming. So, imagine your fate if you actually want to learn and grow! 

* Diversity is highly advertised but followed only on postures and bill boards. Institutional racism is clearly visible and felt but of-course as it happens to only non-privileged people, everyone would say it's not real and just a mind-set.

* If you are in the US, if you're an out-sider, you get condescended by the locals. If you're a local, you get to work with people who know nothing about US life or work culture. It's a thorn with pointy end on both sides! 

* The list goes on if I have to rant and nit pick; bottom line is. In every service-based org, your experience and luck depends on what kind of project and which team you'll end up after a year or 2. 
Sometimes it can be good but most of the time, with a mammoth sized org which keeps acquiring new orgs and builds toxic work culture, it's not good for talented people. 
Use the points above and choose wisely!"

In my particular situation, it's nice to be able to work globally and remotely. I get to meet really cool people and work on some cool stuff. The pay is good and the benefits are solid.","There can be too many moving parts and often times this leads to things being overlooked. There's also a lot of growth happening so you have to kind of find your own way most of the time and since I was just thrown into an entirely new role, this is challenging. Especially since it's a role that I didn't plan to move into. Management hasn't been very helpful with the transition either because they are all hyper-focused on the process changes and I'm not looped into those conversations at all, so I'm on my own.

Being told I was getting one role for months --> then hearing we didn't have the budget for the new role --> hearing there's another role with equitable compensation that I can move into and then seeing the original role given to a coworker was disheartening and really damaged my perception of how Accenture values it's people. Considering that's a core value of Accenture, I figured they would treat one of their more senior people on this particular project with a little more respect/compassion."
